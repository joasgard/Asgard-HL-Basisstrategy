# DEPRECATED - No longer used
# This bot now uses Privy for secure wallet infrastructure.
# Private keys are never stored locally.
#
# Instead, use:
# - wallet_address.txt (your EVM address from Privy for Hyperliquid)
# - privy_app_id.txt (your Privy app ID)
# - privy_app_secret.txt (your Privy app secret)
# - privy_auth.pem (your ECDSA authorization key)
#
# See GETTING_STARTED.md for setup instructions.
