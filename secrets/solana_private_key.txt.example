# DEPRECATED - No longer used
# This bot now uses Privy for secure wallet infrastructure.
# Private keys are never stored locally.
# 
# Instead, use:
# - solana_wallet_address.txt (your Solana address from Privy)
# - privy_app_id.txt (your Privy app ID)
# - privy_app_secret.txt (your Privy app secret)
# - privy_auth.pem (your ECDSA authorization key)
#
# See GETTING_STARTED.md for setup instructions.
